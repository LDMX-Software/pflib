# pflib Analysis
These analysis scripts are meant to be _simple_ and _fast_.

They use `pandas` and `matplotlib`.
It is **not recommended** to do these analyses on the ZCU itself
due to disk space constraints, but you've been warned.

```
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install pandas matplotlib
```
