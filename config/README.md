# HGC ROC YAML Settings
This is a collection of YAML settings that have been loaded onto the HGC ROCs and are generally considered "important" for some reason.

top.yaml | Load necessary Top parameters for readout
globalana\_refvolt\_mastertdc.yaml | Other global parameters that can be loaded once for all channels
charge\_injection.yaml | Deactivate most channels and selectively activate a few channels for charge injection
