# Generating fire docs
The fire documentation is generated with [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html)
using the fancy [doxygen-awesome](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css) theme
for the C++ code and using [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html)
for the python package. In order to obtain the same styling as the online documentation,
you must make sure the doxygen-awesome submodule is downloaded. You can do this with
```
git submodule update --init
```

You can generate a local copy of the documentation after installing doxygen and sphinx.
We assume that doxygen is run from the root directory of the fire repository.
```
doxygen docs/doxyfile
```
The output of the documentation then is put into the `docs/html` folder.
Then you can use sphinx to generate to Python documentation using
```
sphinx-build docs/python docs/html/python
```
You can then look at them locally using your favorite browser.

The online documentation includes hyperlinks that jump between the C++ documentation
generated by doxygen and the Python documentation generated by sphinx. These hyperlinks
refer to the root directory of the destination github site and so they **will not** function
when building the documentation locally.
